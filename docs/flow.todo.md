I am obsessed with laravel filament... so make everything about data demo page is highly available to customizable for consumer and developer while also make them so easy to use in the most less code and effort.

===

data demo page: we need centralized control of (search, filter, sort) for amazing UX . reusable for all view mode

===

data demo page: stats card should only be horizontally scrollable, not vertically

===

fix: message page : opening message thread from list causing this error

===

data demo page: data demo detail page: overlay side pane: remove back to list text button

===

data demo page: list  view mode: remove line separator

===

data demo page: the data model should be based on message page,

===

data demo page: calendar view : just like date property that user can select, also add calendar item background color that user can select based on what data

===

data demo page: calendar view : fix flickering calendar items animation on load within blocks

===

data demo page: calendar view control: I want all the features real working, also make the UI styling and spacing consistent global style.

===

data demo page: list view should be super responsive, how many attributes to show is depending on the widht viewport size

=== DONE

data demo page: list view should be like notion list view, so the item not like cards

=== DONE

data demo page: lets turn stats card to become horizontally slideable, should only need one row even on small screen... for responsive design, just make the stats cards smaller

and add more stats cards than 4

=== DONE

data demo page: should gsap animamte auto hide stats card on page scroll down for all view mode, just like SliverAppBar in flutter, so user can focus on the content.

=== DONE

calendar view grid block should be aware of viewport so know how much columns to show for certain widht size

=== DONE

data demo page: calendar view

- add calendar view control (make sure UX cohesive) so user can control:
  1. wether to show all items on calendar blocks or only first 3/5 items with show all text button
  2. what data to show on calendar items within blocks
  3. user can select any timestamp type data to show on calendar view

=== DONE

data demo page:

- create calendar view mode with amazing UI... at least like below ex:
- the styling should consistent with other view mode and global style.
- should use existing components like @/components/ui/tabs etc

=== DONE

1. the kanban view mode should also has grouping selector just like other view mode
2. also make sure the kanban is horizontally scrollable for extensive data group

=== DONE

data demo page: create kanban board view mode with amazing UI... at least like below ex:

===

split view mode : loosing view mode switcher hover on pane active left:right pane

===

view mode switcher actions not working well from overlay side pane: especially fullscreen,and normal mode

===

-message page : message list: time ago use short word like 3s ago, 3m ago, 3h ago etc
-message thread : add message search feature

=== DONE

message page : message list:

1. we have open, unAssigned, done tabs. add `Me` (assigned to me)
2. reduce tabs size
3. show data count on tab hover only

=== DONE

mental model:

message page : sometimes each audience has relation to certain company, and we can relate that audience to another audience within the same company also we can give the job title of a company to each audience

1. present the mental model to message page UI UX with amazing look and cohesive manner
2. always follow the architecture model that each audience, message, company are basically task units

=== DONE

split mode view on message page: should always set right pane to default value on page refresh on load because sometimes user from another page resize the right pane so global appshell size applied also in message page

=== DONE

modify animated tab switcher: while user switch tabs, the content should gsap slide left right animate... also should not re render content like in datademo

=== DONE

msssage page : message thread: we need custom scrollbar component where certain audience journey like (Consult, Order, Complain, Reorder) is represented by a clickable dot on the track. Each dot should show a preview of the message on hover and scroll the main content to that message when clicked.

so itâ€™s effectively a synthetic, content-aware minimap/scrollbar hybrid: it gives both continuous scrolling (via the handle) and discrete navigation (via the dots).

UI example like below

=== DONE

message page : message thread: bottom message input area should animate slide in/up responding to thread locked state

===

1. scroll to bottom not appear in dashboard page
2. also not working on message thread in message page

---

have you make sure the scroll to bottom icon button in message thread not obsturcting message input field area?

also make sure works in dashboard page

===

scroll to bottom in dashboard is not stick to right bottom.
also why not auto applied to another page like demo data?

===

view mode switcher should be on overlay side pane header, replacing current switcher.

make sure the feature working well from overlay side pane: especially fullscreen,and normal mode


=== DONE

login page, the two column left right needs distinctive background color

=== DONE

data demo page:

- data list is not rendered when view mode change: split view mode, overlay side pane view mode
- also view mode should not be affected when user interact with content like changing data view mode

  "src/App.tsx",
  "src/components/layout/ViewModeSwitcher.tsx",
  "src/hooks/useAppViewManager.hook.ts",
  "src/pages/DataDemo/components/DataViewModeSelector.tsx",
  "src/pages/DataDemo/index.tsx",
  "src/store/appShell.store.ts"

=== DONE

top bar: left aligned is only for the breadcrumb, everything else should right aligned

=== DONE

dark light mode is not persisted on refresh

=== DONE

message page: sidebar should always be collapsed for message page on first load and page refresh

=== DONE

overlay side pane: fix erratic close open movement while user resizing the pane

  "src/App.tsx",
  "src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx",
  "src/hooks/useAppViewManager.hook.ts",
  "src/hooks/useResizablePanes.hook.ts",
  "src/store/appShell.store.ts"

=== DONE

on overlay side pane active: the main right content view should not be re-rendered

=== DONE

 animated tabs: should horizontally scrollable by default. so consumer no need to implement individually, also prevent from vertically scrollable

=== DONE

message page:

lets refactor the architecture of message:

- we need to have mental model of message is basically to do list with its properties like (due date, status, relationship, description, labels)

- present the mental model to UI UX with amazing look and cohesive manner

=== DONE

we need UI UX state for case where certain message is currently handled by another agent. if human agent, should request for approval to take over, if AI agent, no need for approval

=== DONE

message page: message list

1. we need more advanced feature than [ all | unread ] like [ Open, Close ] , [ Assigned | unAssigned ] etc

  1.1 those shorcuts should also available as child/sub page in sidebar

2. message list item:

  2.1. we need kind of badge/tag to show each customer journey point for each contact
  2.2. we alo need avatar of which human/ai agent that the item currently assigned

=== DONE

message page:

1. view mode switcher action/purpose is not working well for message page. make it work!
2. also message list with its profil detail cannot be opened as overlay side pane. fix it!
3. cannot open notification page and setting page as overlay side pane from message page. fix it!

message page should comply the app shell view mode!

=== DONE

message page: message list column pane: animated tabs

the tab line should inline with header bottom line

===

message page: message list column pane:

1. when app view mode management tell that the widht is so narrow, then message list column pane should automatically turn into collapsed state

2. also when message list column pane is collapsed, the widht of the column should auto follow the shrinked widht of the children

=== DONE

message page: message list column: resizable sidebar border: I hate when it perceived like there is doubling vertical line

=== DONE

message page:
should has capability to inform the view mode managemnt about the split view mode ;

widht portion:

message list : 20%
message thread : 40%
profile detail : 40%

all above should be sensitive to sidebar collapse and decollapse

=== DONE

each page should can decide to view mode management about how much proportion of screen widht for split view mod and overlay side pane mode

example like case of message split view mode layout, currently the message list left pane too widht eats right pane of message thread and profile detail

=== DONE

1.  sidebar toggle should not in top bar, it should be within sidebar, just right side of logo.
2. breadcrumb should left aligned in top bar at edge left side

=== DONE

on splid view mode active, should hide top bar... only reveal on hovering top area

=== DONE

data demo page: on each view mode, need additional item as CTA to lure user to add more data

=== DONE

create omni (WA, IG, FB) channel CRM messaging page. make sure UI amazing and UX cohesive

===

make the codebase highly DRY without UI UX regression

===

make the codebase highly DRY without UI UX regression... by eliminating props drilling, so should use global state at leaf components

4. again,  user should still can enjoy data item detail page in all view mode format

5. also the breadcrumb navigation should aware the data detail page

6. when data item detail overlay side pane opened, the normal view should persist state of data list page so user can explore another data from list while viewing the data item detail in overlay side pane mode

=== DONE

maybe something like

<SidebarMenuItem>
  <SidebarMenuButton asChild>
    <a href="#">

mental model: every page main content body can be side pane able. reversible. so user can enjoy wether to minimize or maximize page to side pane or full page view

===

mental model: side pane is basically the minimalistic version of the main body content,,, so we need full body button to the sidepane. so now it triggered at full strect of resiable or trough button well actually it should basically transitioned to (example: setting page)
