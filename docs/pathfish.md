Reasoning:
  Executing Parts 1 & 2 to lay the foundation for the Kanban view and create its static component structure.
  First, I'll update the core types to make the application aware of the new `'kanban'` view mode. This is essential for type safety and integration.
  Next, I'll update the `DataViewModeSelector` component to include a button for the new Kanban view, making it accessible to the user. I'll use the `LayoutDashboard` icon for this.
  Now, I will create the new `DataKanbanView.tsx` file. This component will render the columns and cards. For now, it will be a static representation; interactivity will be added in the next part. I'll style it closely to the provided example, using existing shared components where it makes sense.
  Finally, I'll integrate the new Kanban view into the main `DataDemoPage` component. This involves adding the conditional rendering logic and a `useEffect` to automatically group data by status when switching to the Kanban view, which is essential for it to display correctly.

ðŸš€ Applying patch c4086d77 for 'jeli-app-shell'...
Reasoning:
  Excellent, let's bring this Kanban board to life. I'll execute the final two parts of our plan, focusing on adding the drag-and-drop interactivity and ensuring a seamless integration.
  First, to support persisting the changes, I'll add an `updateItem` action to our Zustand store. This will allow the Kanban board to eventually sync its state with our central data source.
  Now, the main event. I'll upgrade `DataKanbanView.tsx` with full drag-and-drop functionality using local state for immediate visual feedback. This includes setting up drag handlers, managing the dragged item's state, and providing visual cues like opacity changes and dropzone highlighting. When a drop occurs, the component will update its local state and call the `updateItem` action we just added to ensure the change is recorded.
  This completes the implementation. The `DataDemo` feature now boasts a fully functional, visually appealing Kanban board, seamlessly integrated with the existing view management and state systems.
