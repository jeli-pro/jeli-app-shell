Alright, let's architect this refactor. The goal is to drop a seriously slick Kanban board view into the `DataDemo` page. We're talking drag-and-drop, clean aesthetics, the works. No messing around with heavy DnD libs; we'll leverage what the browser gives us.

The current setup is a good launchpadâ€”it's already componentized and state-driven. We'll just extend it. This involves defining the new view type, adding the UI switch, building the board component itself, and then wiring it all into the main page logic. We'll manage the DnD state locally at first to nail the UX, with a clear path to persist changes via the existing Zustand store. This is about shipping a feature that not only works but feels great to use.

The plan is to slice this into four logical parts: foundational updates, component creation, implementing interactivity, and final integration. This approach minimizes complexity at each stage and ensures a clean, maintainable result. Let's get this thing built.

  title: 'Implement Kanban Board View for Data Demo Page'
  introduction: |
    This plan outlines the addition of a new 'Kanban' view mode to the Data Demo feature. The goal is to create a visually appealing, interactive board with columns based on data groups (like 'status') and draggable cards representing data items. This will enhance data visualization and user interaction beyond the existing list, card, and table views.

    The approach involves four main phases. First, we'll establish the foundation by updating type definitions and UI controls to recognize the new Kanban view. Second, we will build the core `DataKanbanView` component, focusing on rendering the columns and cards with a modern aesthetic inspired by the user's example. Third, we will implement the drag-and-drop (DnD) functionality using the native HTML5 API for a lightweight and responsive experience. Finally, we'll integrate the new component into the main `DataDemoPage`, ensuring it works seamlessly with the existing view management and data grouping logic.

      status: 'todo'
      name: 'Part 1: Foundational Updates for Kanban View'
      reason: |
        Before building the UI, we need to make the application aware of the new 'kanban' view mode. This involves updating core type definitions, the view mode selector component, and the URL state manager to handle the new option. This ensures the rest of the implementation can be built on a solid, recognized foundation.

          name: '1. Update ViewMode Type Definition'
          reason: |
            To formally introduce the Kanban view, the `ViewMode` type in `types.ts` must be extended. This is a critical first step for type safety and enabling logic for the new view throughout the feature.

          operations:

            - "Add `'kanban'` as one of the possible literal types. The new type should be `export type ViewMode = 'list' | 'cards' | 'grid' | 'table' | 'kanban'`. "

          name: '2. Add Kanban Icon to View Mode Selector'
          reason: |
            The user needs a way to switch to the new Kanban view. This step adds a dedicated button to the `DataViewModeSelector` component, making the new view discoverable and accessible.

            - "In the `modes` array within the `DataViewModeSelector` component, add a new object for the Kanban view: `{ id: 'kanban', label: 'Kanban', icon: LayoutDashboard }`."
            - "This will automatically render the new button and handle the `onClick` event via the existing `handleModeClick` function."

          reason: |
            The `useAppViewManager` hook is the source of truth for view state derived from the URL. While it should work generically with the new 'kanban' value, it's good practice to confirm no hardcoded logic would prevent it from functioning correctly.

            - "The existing line `const viewMode = (searchParams.get('view') as ViewMode) ?? 'list'` should handle `'kanban'` correctly thanks to the type change in the previous step. No code change is likely needed, this is a verification step."

    Upon completion of this plan, the Data Demo feature will be significantly enhanced with a new, fully interactive Kanban board view. This not only provides a powerful new way for users to visualize and manage their data but also showcases the extensibility of the existing application architecture. The new `DataKanbanView` component will be a well-encapsulated, reusable piece of UI, and the foundational changes will ensure it is a first-class citizen alongside the other view modes.
