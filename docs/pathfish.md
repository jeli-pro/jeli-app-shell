Here's the master plan, crafted in hacker news style.

---

Alright, team. We've got a decent amount of React code here, but it's starting to smell. The same bits of URL-munging logic are popping up all over the place like whack-a-mole. Every time we want to open a side pane or switch a view, we're hand-rolling `URLSearchParams`. It's a recipe for drift and bugs. This is classic tech debt.

The plan is to mercilessly refactor this into a DRY, state-driven machine. We're going to introduce a single source of truth for all view-state mutationsâ€”a `useAppViewManager` hook. This little beast will be our gatekeeper for the URL. Components will no longer talk to the router directly; they'll talk to our manager, which speaks router on their behalf. This makes components dumb and declarative, which is exactly what we want.

We'll then gut all the redundant logic from the components and replace it with clean calls to our new hook. We'll also clean up the main `App` component, which is doing way too much thinking about what goes in the right pane. We'll delegate that to a dedicated hook. By the end, our codebase will be leaner, meaner, and a hell of a lot easier to reason about. Let's ship it.

  title: 'Refactor URL State Management to be DRY'
  introduction: |
    The current codebase has logic for manipulating URL search parameters scattered across multiple components (`TopBar`, `CommandPalette`, `EnhancedSidebar`, `App`, `DataDemo`). This repetition makes the system difficult to maintain, reason about, and extend. State transitions are imperative and error-prone.

    This master plan will centralize all URL-based view state management into a single custom hook: `useAppViewManager`. This hook will provide a declarative API for components to request state changes (e.g., `openSidePane('settings')`), abstracting away the underlying implementation of `useSearchParams` and `useNavigate`.

    By refactoring components to use this centralized hook, we will significantly reduce code duplication, improve separation of concerns, and make the application's state flow predictable and robust. We will also streamline content rendering logic in the main `App` component for better clarity.

        To eliminate redundant URL manipulation logic by creating a single, authoritative hook that manages all view-state changes. This is the cornerstone of the entire refactoring effort, establishing a DRY pattern for state management.

          reason: |
            This new hook will encapsulate all interactions with `react-router-dom`'s `useSearchParams`, `useLocation`, and `useNavigate`. It will serve as the single interface for components to query and modify the application's view state.

  conclusion: |
    Upon completion, the codebase will be significantly more maintainable. The introduction of `useAppViewManager` provides a single, clear API for state transitions, eliminating scattered and duplicated logic. Components will become simpler and more focused on their rendering responsibilities.

    This refactoring improves developer experience by making the state flow explicit and predictable. Future features involving new views or panes can be added with minimal effort by extending the view manager, ensuring the architecture remains clean and scalable.
